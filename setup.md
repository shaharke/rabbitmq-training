## Setup

### Spin a Docker image

To make thing easy we're going to use a Docker image that runs the RabbitMQ broker. This way you won't need to install RabbitMQ on your machine. If you're not familiar with Docker you can read more about it [here](https://www.docker.com), although it's really not necessary for this training. However, in order to run the following commands you do need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/overview) installed on your workstation.

```
$ docker pull rabbitmq
$ docker run -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 -d --name rabbitmq rabbitmq
$ docker exec rabbitmq rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
```
It's a good practice to check your docker container status, in order to validate it's up and ready to work.
```
$ docker ps -a
```
In case you already installed the docker container, and for some reason it's down (status = 'Exited' or any other reason),run the next command:
```
docker start rabbitmq
```
Check again your container status, and you are ready to go.

### Open the Administration console:

Browse to [http://localhost:15672/](http://localhost:15672) and login into the management console:  
User: **guest**  
Password: **guest**

### Download RabbitMQ Admin CLI

```
$ curl http://localhost:15672/cli/rabbitmqadmin > /usr/local/bin/rabbitmqadmin
$ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rabbitmqadmin

# Check that it works:
$ rabbitmqadmin list exchanges 
```
